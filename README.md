# NNFM-A-Novel-Neural-Network-Modeling-Approach-for-Robot-Flexible-Joints-Friction
This is the data and code project for the paper “NNFM: A Novel Neural Network Modeling Approach for Robot Flexible Joints Friction Considering Abrupt Non-smooth Properties.”

Actual hardware videos for this project have been uploaded to https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1y3y3BSEBh/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=83610511874e6772be8d89806afc2f82

1. The FAIRINO Robot Dataset and Franka Robot Dataset folders contain raw data collected from two distinct robotic platforms, corresponding to the four different trajectories and three distinct velocity conditions described in the paper. This includes joint angles, joint angular velocities, and joint friction torques.

2. The Joint Compensation Experimental Data folder corresponds to the data in Figure 9 of the paper.

3. The Comparative Data folder corresponds to the comparative data and fig source files associated with Figures 7 through 12 in the text.

4.The Data Collection Program folder corresponds to the hardware source programs for data acquisition on different robot platforms.

5.The MATLAB program for parameter identification folder contains M-language script programs for identifying parameters of traditional models (CV, Dahl, Stribeck, LuGre).

6.The Identification Parameters folder contains the model parameters identified under conditions case1 through case4 (CV, Dahl, Stribeck, LuGre).

7.The MATLAB program for processing data and generating plots folder contains MATLAB scripts for data processing and plotting, corresponding to Figures 6 through 12.

8.The Robot Platform Hardware Verification Program folder contains all source code for programs running on both robot platforms.
